# CodeSpellV3 Multiplayer
This is a rewrite of the original CodeSpell game. 

You can download the binary releases from:
[https://github.com/codespellv3/cs_mp/releases](https://github.com/codespellv3/cs_mp/releases)  

If you want to modify the source, the Unity version I used for development is 2018.3.14f1. Newer version might be incompatible. 

Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/codespellv3/cs_mp/wiki) for additional information on how to use this repo.

You can find more information on the old versions [here](https://github.com/thoughtstem/CodeSpellsV3).
